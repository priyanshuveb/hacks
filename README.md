## Re-Entrancy
## Self-destruct
```solidity
selfdestruct(address payable recipient)
```
Destroys the current contract, sending its funds to the given Address and end execution. The receiving contractâ€™s receive function is not executed.
<br>

A contract either requires a fallback or receive function to receive any ether into it otherwise it rejects the incoming ether. The self-destruct  function bypasses that and forcefully sends the ether into that the receiving contract, the receiving contract need not be implementing fallback/receive function.
